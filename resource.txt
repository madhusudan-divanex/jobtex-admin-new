Personal & professional details entry
 
1. CV Parsing from Uploads 
- User uploads CV (PDF/DOCX format).
- AI Model (Gemini Flash 2.0) processes the document to extract key details such as:  
  - Personal Information (Name, Email, Phone, Address)  
  - Work Experience (Job Titles, Companies, Durations)  
  - Education (Degrees, Institutions, Years)  
  - Skills & Certifications  
- Parsed data is mapped to the user profile fields, allowing the user to review and edit before saving.  

2. LinkedIn Data Extraction 
- User connects to a LinkedIn account via OAuth API.  
- Upon authorization, the system fetches:  
  - Profile Summary (Bio, Headline, Location)  
  - Experience (Companies, Job Titles, Duration)  
  - Education & Certifications  
  - Skills & Endorsements  
- Extracted data is auto-filled into the user profile, which the admin can access.  

3. Admin Access to Extracted Data  
- The Admin Panel will have a section to  view, manage, and verify  user profiles.  
- Admin can fetch details directly from parsed CVs or LinkedIn data.  
- Admin can edit, approve, or flag  incomplete/inaccurate data.  
- Reports & analytics can track profile completeness and accuracy
